/*
 * One build of one half of one index.
 *
 * Every index is built in two halves -- the vanilla install and the workspace -- and all four
 * indexes did it with the same hundred lines: start a timer, list the files, load the manifest,
 * work out what is still fresh, restore that from the cache, parse whatever is left through the
 * shared queue while reporting progress, then write the cache back. Those copies were identical
 * down to the comment text, which is why every fix to the indexing had to be made four times.
 *
 * What genuinely differs between them is the shape of what they cache, so that is what the two
 * callbacks cover: `hydrate` puts one cached record back into the live index, and `serialize` hands
 * back the records that should be written. Everything else is here.
 *
 * A cache is a list of small records -- in practice one per indexed file -- rather than one
 * document, so that neither the write nor the load ever holds the whole index as a single string,
 * and both can give the extension host back its event loop as they go.
