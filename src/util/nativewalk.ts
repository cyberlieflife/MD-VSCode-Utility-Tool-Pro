 * also an RPC per directory, and for anything under the HOI4 install path it is *two* -- the
 * `hoi4installpath:` FileSystemProvider lives in the extension host and answers by calling
 * `vscode.workspace.fs` again. An index build over a mod the size of Millennium Dawn walks nearly
 * four thousand files, so the difference between a syscall and a round trip is the difference
 * between a fifth of a second and minutes.
 *
 * This module is node-only. It is loaded through `require` from inside an `if (!IS_WEB_EXT)` block so
 * webpack's DefinePlugin drops the branch and never tries to resolve `node:fs/promises` for the web
 * bundle, which has no `fs` at all.
