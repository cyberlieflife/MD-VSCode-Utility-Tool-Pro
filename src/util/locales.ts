/*
 * The languages the extension knows about, in one place.
 *
 * This used to be four tables in three files: localisationIndex.ts held ISO code -> yml suffix and
 * setting name -> ISO code, vsccommon.ts held a third mapping setting name -> yml suffix directly,
 * which was the composition of the other two, and the world map's state loader spelled the
 * setting-name table out again. Adding a language meant remembering all of them and keeping them
 * consistent, and nothing checked that they were.
 *
 * The setting names below are the enum of `mdHoi4Utilities.previewLocalisation` in package.json
 * and have to keep matching it. The suffixes are what Paradox localisation files carry, as in
 * `focus_l_english.yml`.
