/*
 * Turning `traits = { army_chief_planning_3 }` into the modifiers that trait actually grants.
 *
 * A character carries no modifiers of its own. Everything it does to a country is written in the
 * traits it names, and those live in three directories that spell a trait three different ways:
 *
 *   common/country_leader/    politician and advisor traits, wrapped in `leader_traits = { }`.
 *                             Modifiers are written FLAT at the trait's top level, by the base
 *                             game and Millennium Dawn alike; a `modifier = { }` block occurs too,
 *                             often in the same directory.
 *   common/unit_leader/       commander traits, also wrapped in `leader_traits = { }`, with
 *                             `modifier`, `non_shared_modifier` and the two per-role blocks, plus
 *                             flat skill fields of their own.
 *   common/scientist_traits/  no wrapper at all -- the traits are the file's own children.
 *
 * Two rules cover all three. The wrapper is found rather than assumed: a file that has a
 * `leader_traits` node contributes its children, and a file that does not contributes its own. And
 * a flat scalar is a modifier unless it is named in `structuralKeys` below -- which is what makes
 * `army_chief_logistics_1 = { sprite = 6  experience_gain_army = 0.05 ... }` produce a modifier
 * line instead of nothing.
 *
 * Where that guesses wrong the symptom is a nonsense line on a card and the fix is one entry in
 * `structuralKeys`, or, for a key only one mod writes, in the characterTraitStructuralKeys setting
 * or a `character_trait_structural_keys = { }` list in its .mod file. That is the same trade, and
 * the same remedy, as builtinOverrides in util/modifiers.ts.
