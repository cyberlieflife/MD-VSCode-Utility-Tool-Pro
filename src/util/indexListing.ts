/*
 * What the four index builds ask the filesystem for, in one place.
 *
 * Each of them used to do this in two passes: list the names under a folder, then walk that list
 * resolving every name back to a path and stat'ing it. The second pass was the expensive one -- for
 * the vanilla half it stat'd the install path and every DLC folder, per file, through a filesystem
 * provider that answers by calling vscode.workspace.fs again -- and it was asking for something the
 * listing had already been holding. Now the listing hands back names, URIs and mtimes together, and
 * the second pass only runs for files a listing could not date: the web build, a remote install path,
 * or a file deleted between the walk and its stat.
