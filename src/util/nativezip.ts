 * A random-access reader for zip archives, for the HOI4 DLC zips.
 *
 * The alternative, and what this replaces, is adm-zip: `new AdmZip(path)` is a `readFileSync` of the
 * whole archive, and it has no way to read one entry without it. A DLC zip is tens to hundreds of
 * megabytes and an index build reads thousands of entries out of one, so the cost of reading a
 * hundred-byte localisation file was a hundred-megabyte synchronous read on the extension host's
 * only thread. Here an entry read is the central directory (already in memory), one positioned read
 * of the compressed bytes, and an inflate on libuv's threadpool.
 *
 * This module is node-only. It is loaded through `require` from inside an `if (!IS_WEB_EXT)` block so
 * webpack's DefinePlugin drops the branch and never tries to resolve `node:fs/promises` for the web
 * bundle, which has no `fs` at all.
