// DDS/TGA -> PNG decode abstraction. On the desktop (node) build it offloads decoding to a pool of
// long-lived worker_threads workers so a focus tree full of DDS icons doesn't stall the extension
// host. The pool grows on demand: a single DDS view spawns one worker, while a render that queues
// many decodes at once (a focus tree) widens the pool so the CPU-bound DDS/TGA->PNG conversion
// parallelizes across cores instead of serializing on one thread. On the web build (or when no
// worker can be spawned, after every worker crashes, or whenever a queued job comes back failed) it
// falls back to a synchronous decode that is byte-for-byte identical to the original inline getImage
// path.
//
// worker_threads and every other node-only require live strictly inside `if (!IS_WEB_EXT)` blocks
// (mirroring fileloader.ts) so terser dead-code-eliminates them from the web bundle.
