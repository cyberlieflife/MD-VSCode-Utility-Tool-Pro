 *
 * Same ordering constraint as warningstyles.ts: `StyleTable.toStyleElement` snapshots its records
 * at call time, so anything registered after `#focustreeplaceholder` has been filled never reaches
 * the page. These live in the shell, emitted once before any render.
 *
 * The selectors below spell the class names out rather than interpolating the constants, and a
 * test asserts both names appear in the emitted CSS so the two can never drift apart.

    // connects. 5 keeps it below the warning marker box at 6.
